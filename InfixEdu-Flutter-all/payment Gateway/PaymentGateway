A Flutter plugin that wraps the native Braintree SDKs. Unlike other plugins, this plugin not only lets you start Braintree's native Drop-in UI, but also allows you to create your own custom Flutter UI with Braintree functionality.

Go to the Developer account of BrainTree and generate your client token from dashboard , For testing purpose you need to generate sandBox token  or For Production you need to generate production token and place the token in app.
